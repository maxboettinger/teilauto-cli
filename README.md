An unofficial command-line client for [teilauto](https://teilauto.net)/CityFlitzer
carsharing (Leipzig & Mitteldeutschland). Search cars, check prices, and manage
bookings without opening a browser — plus `teilauto autobook`, which watches for
a matching car and books it the instant one becomes free, then pings you on
Telegram or ntfy.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install teilauto-cli     # or: pipx install teilauto-cli
```

Requires Python 3.10+.

## 30 seconds to your first car

```bash
teilauto auth login                        # once; token lasts ~90 days
teilauto config set location.lat 51.3455    # your home coordinates (default: Leipzig Hbf — set your own!)
teilauto config set location.lng 12.3821
teilauto cars list                          # what's nearby?
teilauto bookings create 111 --for 1h       # book the VW Polo for an hour
```

`cars list` shows what's parked around you, closest first:

```
                                        Cars

└─────┴─────────┴───────────┴──────┴──────────┴─────────────────────────┴───────────┘
```

## Autobook (the good part)

`autobook` runs `cars list` on a loop and books the first car that matches your
criteria — no manual refreshing, no lost race against other members.

```bash
teilauto autobook --radius 800 --deadline 18:00
```

What it does:

1. Prints the criteria (location, booking window, min fuel, deadline) and
   asks you to confirm — skip with `--yes` (required if you also pass `--json`,
   since JSON mode can't prompt).
2. Polls `cars list` every `--interval` seconds (120s by default) for cars
   newly available in your window.
3. Books the first match, notifies you, and exits immediately.
   If a booking attempt fails (someone beat you to it), that car is retried up
   to 3 times before autobook gives up on it and moves on.
4. Give up early with `--until` (also usable as the booking's fixed end time)
   or `--deadline` — autobook exits with code 2 once the deadline passes with
   nothing booked.
5. `--dry-run` does everything except the actual booking (no login required)
   — use it to sanity-check your criteria first.

**About the booking window:** CityFlitzer bills actual usage — the first
started hour in full, then 15-minute steps, plus kilometers — and the booked
end time is rewritten to when you actually end the trip. The window `--for`
sets (default: 1h) is a formality the API requires and only affects the
availability check, so you neither overpay by booking long nor need to extend
a short booking.

This spends real money on your real account the moment a match is found.
There's an inherent race: someone else's app can win the same car between your
poll and your booking request — that's what the retry logic is for, not a bug.

## Notifications

Configure Telegram, ntfy, or both — `watch` and `autobook` send updates through
whichever channels you enable.

**Telegram** — create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), then:

```bash
teilauto config set notify.telegram.bot_token 123456:ABC-your-bot-token   # stored in OS keyring
teilauto config set notify.telegram.chat_id 987654321                    # your chat/user id
teilauto config set notify.channels telegram
```

**ntfy** — pick a topic name, subscribe to it in the [ntfy app](https://ntfy.sh/),
then:

```bash
teilauto config set notify.ntfy.topic my-teilauto-alerts
teilauto config set notify.channels telegram,ntfy   # comma-separated to use both
```

Verify either (or both) with:

```bash
teilauto notify test
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `teilauto auth login` | Log in; stores a session token good for ~90 days. |
| `teilauto auth status` | Show whether you're logged in and until when. |
| `teilauto auth logout` | Delete the stored token. |
| `teilauto cars list` | List cars near a location, closest first. |
| `teilauto cars show CAR_ID` | Car detail plus blocked time ranges (next 24h by default). |
| `teilauto price CAR_ID` | Price of booking a car for a time window. Login required for real prices; unauthenticated requests return "unknown". For CityFlitzer the API always prices a fixed 48h worst case regardless of the requested window — actual billing follows usage. |
| `teilauto providers list` | Operators you can log in to — pick your `api.prov_id` from here. |
| `teilauto bookings list` | Your bookings (upcoming only by default). |
| `teilauto bookings show BOOKING_ID` | One booking in detail. |
| `teilauto bookings create CAR_ID` | Book a car for a time window (asks for confirmation; skip with `--yes`, required if you also pass `--json`). |
| `teilauto bookings cancel BOOKING_ID` | Cancel a booking. |
| `teilauto watch` | Poll for newly available cars and notify — never books. |
| `teilauto autobook` | Poll and book the first match automatically. |
| `teilauto notify test` | Send a test message through every configured channel. |
| `teilauto config list/get/set/unset/path` | Inspect and edit configuration. |

Every command and group supports `-h`/`--help` for its full option list.

## Configuration

Config lives in a TOML file; run `teilauto config path` to find it (it uses
[platformdirs](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/), so the location
follows OS convention — e.g. `~/.config/teilauto/config.toml` on Linux).
`teilauto config list` shows the effective configuration — defaults, then file,
then environment overrides:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `location.lat` | `51.3455` | Home latitude used when `--lat` isn't given (default: Leipzig Hbf — set your own). |
| `location.lng` | `12.3821` | Home longitude used when `--lng` isn't given (default: Leipzig Hbf — set your own). |
| `location.radius_m` | `500` | Default search radius in metres. |
| `defaults.min_fuel` | `0.0` | Default minimum fuel level (%) filter. |
| `defaults.window_min` | `30` | Default booking/search window length in minutes. |
| `defaults.interval_sec` | `120` | Default poll interval for `watch`/`autobook`, in seconds. |
| `api.prov_id` | `'118'` | Your operator's Cantamen provider id (default: teilauto Mitteldeutschland) — see `teilauto providers list`. |
| `api.key` | (Carsharing Deutschland app key) | App-level `x-api-key` sent with every request. The default covers all teilauto regions and most German Cantamen-based operators; rarely needs changing. |
| `notify.channels` | `[]` | Active notification channels: `telegram`, `ntfy`, or both. |
| `notify.telegram.chat_id` | `''` | Telegram chat/user id to message. |
| `notify.ntfy.topic` | `''` | ntfy.sh topic to publish to. |
| `notify.ntfy.server` | `'https://ntfy.sh'` | ntfy server, if self-hosting. |

`notify.telegram.bot_token` is a secret and doesn't appear in `config list` —
set it with `config set`, and it's stored in the OS keyring, not the file.

Every key can be overridden with an environment variable:
`TEILAUTO_<SECTION>_<KEY>` (dots become underscores, uppercased) —
e.g. `TEILAUTO_LOCATION_RADIUS_M=800`. Two extra env vars exist outside the
config-key scheme: `TEILAUTO_TOKEN` (override the session token) and
`TEILAUTO_TG_BOT_TOKEN` (override the Telegram bot token), plus
`TEILAUTO_CONFIG_DIR` to point the whole config directory somewhere else
(handy for tests or multiple profiles).

**Secrets** (session token, Telegram bot token) are stored in this order:
OS keyring first; if no keyring is available, a `secrets.json` file in the
config directory with `chmod 600` permissions; environment variables always
win over both. Your account password is never stored anywhere — only the
session token returned by login.

## Other operators (all teilauto regions, stadtmobil, …)

The backend is multi-tenant: dozens of German carsharing operators share it,
distinguished by a provider id. The default configuration is teilauto
Mitteldeutschland (`118`); to use another operator, look up its id and save it:

```bash
teilauto providers list                    # login-eligible operators (no login needed)
teilauto config set api.prov_id 19         # e.g. teilAuto Neckar-Alb (Tübingen)
teilauto auth login                        # log in against that operator
```

Two things to know: the login is your account email or customer number
(Kundennummer) — regional operators commonly use the Kundennummer — and after
changing `api.prov_id` (or `api.key`) you need a fresh `teilauto auth login`,
since the session token belongs to the operator it was issued for.

## JSON output & scripting

Every data-producing command takes `--json` for machine-readable output.

```bash
teilauto cars list --available --json | jq -r '.[].car.name'
teilauto auth status --json | jq .expiry
```

Exit codes are stable and meant for scripting:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Generic error (config problem, API error, aborted confirmation). |
| `2` | Usage error, or no matching car found (`autobook` deadline reached). |
| `3` | Authentication required — not logged in or token expired. |
| `4` | Requested resource not found (e.g. unknown booking id). |

## How it works / API notes

teilauto-cli talks to the Cantamen `casirest/v3` backend at
`https://de1.cantamen.de` — the same multi-tenant API behind the official
`buchen.teilauto.net` booking site and the teilAuto / Carsharing Deutschland
Android apps, reverse-engineered from their traffic and app bundles. Every
request carries a public `x-api-key` that identifies the *app*, not a user, so
it's not treated as a secret here. The default is the Carsharing Deutschland
umbrella app's key, whose login-eligible operator set covers every teilauto
region and most other German Cantamen-based operators (override with the
`api.key` config). Member actions (login, creating/cancelling bookings) use a
session token from `POST /tokens`, scoped to the operator selected via
`api.prov_id`. None of this is an official, documented, or supported API — see
Responsible use below.

## Responsible use

This is an **unofficial** client built by reverse-engineering the public
booking website; it is not affiliated with or endorsed by teilauto or
Cantamen. A few ground rules:

- Built for personal use on your own account, not for scraping at scale.
- Poll gently — the default interval is 120 seconds; don't turn it down
  aggressively across multiple instances.
- `autobook` and `bookings create` spend real money on your real account the
  moment a match is found. Read the confirmation prompt.
- The underlying endpoints are undocumented and can change or break without
  notice — there's no SLA here.

## Future extensions

Not implemented, but reasonable next steps: systemd/launchd service unit
helpers for running `watch`/`autobook` as a background service, geocoding
(address → coordinates, so you don't have to look up lat/lng by hand), and
quiet hours (suppress notifications overnight).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxboettinger/teilauto-cli
cd teilauto-cli
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

Layout: `src/teilauto/api` (Cantamen client + models), `src/teilauto/cli`
(click commands, one module per command group), `src/teilauto/core`
(config, token storage, time parsing, geo), `src/teilauto/services`
(availability matching, notifiers, the poll loop), `src/teilauto/output`
(rendering — rich tables/panels and JSON).
